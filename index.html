          <p>I am a well-rounded human being.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Driven: I am not afraid to confront controversial topics and I love when data reveals stories I didn't know were there.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cool as a cucumber: I am a former 911 dispatcher. I've helped people escape burning buildings, convinced an armed,
            drunk, barricaded man to put the gun down and step outside and I even helped deliver a baby. In other words, I am super
            chill and laser-focused under pressure.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Location Independent: I am a US citizen currently living in Mexico, and I am open to relocation in the United States,
            Canada, New Zealand, and parts of Europe and Latin America.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Volunteerism: I believe in being of service. Of all the volunteer work I’ve done in my life, I am most proud of the work
            I did while living on Maui: I volunteered 300+ hours annually replanting native forest, removing invasive species,
            monitoring and banding native birds, and cleaning beaches. Maui N&#333 Ka ʻOi.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Well-traveled: I have lived in multiple countries. I value and understand the importance of diversity. I speak very bad
            Spanish, but it gets better every week, poco a poco. Ask me what I’ve learned this week – it’s sure to be random.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Excellent childhood hobbies: My fate was sealed when, as a child, my favorite pastimes were to highlight the words I
            looked up in the dictionary and study my family’s atlas of the world.</li>
